# vehicle-detection-and-tracking-project
In this vehicle detection and tracking project, we detect in a video pipeline, potential boxes, via a sliding window, that may contain a vehicle by using a Support Vector Machine Classifier for prediction to create a heat map. The heat map history is then used to filter out false positives before identification of vehicles by drawing a bounding box around it.
